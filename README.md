# Lending club case study
The Lending Club case study typically revolves around analyzing the companyâ€™s loan data to predict loan defaults, identify risk factors, and recommend strategies for investment. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that matches borrowers with investors. The dataset usually includes various borrower information such as loan amount, term, interest rate, grade, employment details, credit history, and more.
